i-Kijiji - Your village on the web
-------------------------------------

i-Kijiji is a Swahili rendition of i-Village (Kijiji is Swahili for village)

In the modern Internet era, it has become the case that rural Africa is not well represented on the canvases of cyberspace. We like to talk of our trips to the mall, the arcade or the tech hub in the heart of our busy connected cities.

But we also have roots in places that are still green and fresh as opposed to grey and hard with steel and concrete.

i-Kijiji is a social network of global villagers who love their villages and are willing to share the pleasures of their rural experience with others, and visit the villages of others the world over.
